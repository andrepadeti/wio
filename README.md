# ELT Games

This is an app I started to develop so that I could play language games with my English language students. It is a work in progress. It's been made with [Node/ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), the database is [MogoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), and the views are [HandlebarsJS](https://handlebarsjs.com/). Later on I rebuilt the frontend in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
